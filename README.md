# Radium Blockchain Node on Ubuntu VM

This template delivers the Radium network to your VM in about 15 mintues.  Everything you need to get started using the Radium blockchain from the command line is included. 

You may then connect via SSH to the VM and launch the 'cli-wallet' to interface with the blockchain.
